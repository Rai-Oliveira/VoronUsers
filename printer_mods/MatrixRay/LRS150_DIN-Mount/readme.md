The idea behind it is simple: Mount a Meanwell LRS-150 to DIN35 rail using a SSR mount.

1x LRS-150  
1x DIN SSR Mount  

# Assembly:

Positioning and tightening on the screw to the right is a bit tricky but possible with the use of a ball end driver.  


Here's a print of an earlier version with issues regarding thin features, later fixed.
